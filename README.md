## Web Developer

### Hello world! :bowtie:

I'm **Ming, a curious self-taught web developer**. For me, programming it's an amazing never-ending learning journey that I am passionately engaged. :grin: 

* So far, I have learned and worked with **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript, ReactJS, Angular, PHP, Databases and RESTful services**. :blush:

Proud of:
 * I finished the intensive **'Codellege'** Front-End bootcamp. :fire:
 * I worked on a Front-End project as React Dev at **HackademyMX**. :fire:
 * Four biotechnology research papers published! :fire:

**Let's build something awesome together!** :punch:
Feel free to contact me!
